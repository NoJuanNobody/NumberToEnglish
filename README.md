second attempt for JP Morgan Test Problem


I had some Ideas after I finished the JP morgan coding interview, although this attempt is not perfect I have been attempting to streamline my enums and algorithm for putting together  for text. my decimal and hundreds method need work, but i have good code coverage and My methodology is Strong, as it is proven in this attempt. also TDD could not be examined in the exam. this is my attempt to show those skills.
