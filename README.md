second attempt for JP Morgan Test Problem


I had some Ideas after I finished the JP morgan coding interview. I wanted to put my best foot forward, with a solution that works correctly. in this repository you will find a Dollars to english translator method that could fit in place of the solution I submited on the exam. I would like this worksample to be an exhibit of how I name classes, write clean, object oriented code, and analyze patterns. 

I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to take this exam, and hope that we may be in contact in the future.
